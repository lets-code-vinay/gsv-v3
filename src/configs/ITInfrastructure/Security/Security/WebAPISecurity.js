      Why It Matters and How GSV Can Help

      Web applications and APIs are essential components of modern software development. They enable businesses to deliver dynamic, interactive, and scalable solutions to their customers and partners. However, they also expose a large attack surface that can be exploited by malicious actors. According to a recent report by Verizon, web application attacks accounted for 39% of all data breaches in 2020, making them the most common source of compromise.
      
      Web application and API security is not just a technical issue, but a business one. A successful attack can result in data loss, reputation damage, regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and customer churn. Moreover, web application and API security is not a one-time effort, but an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and adaptation to the evolving threat landscape.
      
      That's why web application and API security is beneficial for any organization and team that develops, deploys, or manages web-based solutions. It helps to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and services that are critical for business success. It also helps to comply with industry standards and regulations, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and others.
      
      However, web application and API security is not easy to achieve. It requires a combination of skills, tools, methodologies, and best practices that cover the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It also requires a culture of security awareness and collaboration among developers, testers, operations, and security teams.
