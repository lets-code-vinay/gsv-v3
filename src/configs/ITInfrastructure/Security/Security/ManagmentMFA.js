            Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial aspect of any organization's cybersecurity strategy. It ensures that only authorized users can access the right resources at the right time and for the right reasons. However, traditional IAM methods such as passwords and security questions are no longer enough to protect against sophisticated cyberattacks. That's why more and more organizations are adopting multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a way to enhance their IAM capabilities.

            MFA is a process that requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity before accessing a system or application. These pieces of evidence can be something the user knows (such as a password or a PIN), something the user has (such as a smartphone or a token), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint or a face scan). By combining these factors, MFA makes it harder for attackers to compromise user accounts and steal sensitive data.
            
            However, not all MFA solutions are created equal. Some are more secure, convenient, and cost-effective than others. That's why you need to choose the best MFA solution for your organization's needs and goals. And that's where GSV Systems comes in.
