            Cybersecurity is more than just a buzzword. It's a vital necessity for any organization that wants to protect its data, reputation, and operations from the ever-increasing threat of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom for their decryption. If the ransom is not paid, the files are permanently lost or leaked to the public.
