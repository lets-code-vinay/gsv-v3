        Cloud-managed wireless applications are a modern and efficient way to manage the network infrastructure of your organisation. It will help the organisation to allow remote monitoring, configure, and troubleshoot the wireless devices and access points that connect the users and devices to the internet. Some of the benefits of cloud-managed wireless applications for the organisation are:
        - Reduced costs: Cloud-managed wireless applications eliminate the need for expensive hardware controllers and servers, as well as the maintenance and upgrade costs associated with them. The organisation only pays for the cloud service subscription and the wireless devices that it needs.
- Increased scalability: Cloud-managed wireless applications enable the organisation to easily add or remove wireless devices and access points as the network demand changes. The cloud service automatically adjusts the network settings and performance to accommodate the changes.
- Enhanced security: Cloud-managed wireless applications provide the organisation with a centralized and secure platform to manage the network security policies and compliance requirements. The cloud service encrypts the data in transit and at rest and provides regular updates and patches to protect the network from cyber threats.
- Improved visibility: Cloud-managed wireless applications offer the organisation a comprehensive and real-time view of the network status and performance. The organisation can access dashboards, reports, and analytics that show network usage, traffic patterns, device health, user behaviour, and more. The organisation can also receive alerts and notifications for any network issues or anomalies.
- Simplified management: Cloud-managed wireless applications simplify the network management process for the organisation. The organisation can use a web browser or a mobile app to access the cloud service from anywhere and at any time. The organisation can also automate tasks such as device provisioning, firmware updates, backup and restore, and more.

Cloud-managed wireless applications are a smart and convenient solution for organisations that want to optimize their network infrastructure and enhance their productivity and performance.
